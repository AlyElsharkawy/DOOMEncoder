# DOOMEncoder
A simple symmetric encryption program created in Python while I was in high school. **Simple, secure, robust,and efficient.**

## Features
- Full unicode support.
- Security: duplicate keys are nearly impossible to generate.
- Compatibility: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Tab Completion: All commands and their aliases can be completing by pressing the tab key

## Usage
The program is launched by running `DOOMEncoder.py` from any terminal. The program will then accept any of four commands:
1. Encode
2. Decode
3. Generate Key
4. Quit
Typing the `encode` or `decode` commands will then cause the program to ask for a key. A key can be generated by typing the `generate key` command. Also, the `back` command can be used to return to any previous menu.
